DESCRIPTION:[Indian Space Research Organization]\nSSLV\n\nSpace Machines Company (SMC)'s second Optimus Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV)\, will launch on a mission designated Space MAITRI (Mission for Australia-India’s Technology\, Research and Innovation). The mission will focus on debris management and sustainability\, and will significantly advance Australia’s domestic space industry by combining Australian spacecraft capabilities with India's launch expertise.\n\nAfter separation\, Optimus will perform a series of propulsive on-orbit maneuvers to inspect a space object in close proximity. It will then spend several months on orbit examining space debris to demonstrate affordable and accessible space sustainability technologies.
